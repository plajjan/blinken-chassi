warn when smp_discover does not exist

I had an idea about having this nifty app autodetect controllers and try to
fingerprint them into enclosures and so forth. I do no longer believe in that
idea as it is simply to complex and will probably not yield a very good result.

Current ideas are instead along the lines of auto-detecting controllers but
have the user manually enter what enclosures he has. A short configuration
procedure would help to map controllers to front and back of enclosures by
blinking all lights.

At least the Supermicro SC847 is built with two LSI controllers that are
completely independant. Connections between them are on the back of the chassi
and how you connect them are really up to you. It is thus very difficult, if
not impossible, to determine which one is which, unless there are hard-drives
in the chassi. The ports used for the drives on the controllers are different
on the backside and front of the SC847 so having a disk in a slot where they
have no overlap, one could conclude it is either the back or front. If one have
two enclosures, once again, it is impossible to tell which backside controller
belong to which front since the connections could be connected in a arbitrary
fashion.
